# Here are the files to play hangman

## How to play:

## When was this made?
  * The original file HG.py and phrase.txt was made during my freshman year of collage and was my first project ever. From it i learned alot about string splitting
  * the Hangman_Game.py file was made later during junior year when I was trying to learn how to make exe files
